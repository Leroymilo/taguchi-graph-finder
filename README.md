# taguchi-graph-finder
This app find a matching taguchi graph for the interraction you draw (if there's one).
Multiple graph templates included.

To use : download the archive, uncompress it and run graph_finder.exe.

The interface looks really bad but I don't have enough motivation to make a proper interface with rescalable window.
So sorry if your monitor is smaller than 1280x720.
